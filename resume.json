A few years ago, my wanderlust and love programming landed me in Silicon Valley... and I couldn’t be more excited! My experience is with the full Ruby and Javascript stack, both professionally and on countless side projects. I’ve built everything from a profitable WordPress theme creator, to HTML5 games, and web apps to increase my productivity.
