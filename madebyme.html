      <h2>Vim Snake</h2>
      <img src="images/vimsnake.png" alt="Vim Snake">
      <p>Vim Snake is a quick and fun 1 day sprint project to explore HTML5 canvas. The game is built with canvas/javascript/jquery. I used sinatra for the backend and twitter for the login and leaderboard. </p>
      <p>At the time of development, I was learning Vim and decided to use the same navigation controls for snake. The snake can only eat food in INSERT mode, and you cannot change direction until escaping INSERT mode</p>
      <p>On August 16, Vim Snake made the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6223946" target="_blank">front page of Hacker News</a> which resulted in significant exposure and positive feedback.</p>
