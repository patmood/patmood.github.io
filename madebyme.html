      <h2>Vim Snake</h2>
      <img src="images/vimsnake.png" alt="Vim Snake">
      <p>Vim Snake is a quick and fun 1 day sprint project to explore HTML5 canvas. The game is built with canvas/javascript/jquery. I used sinatra for the backend and twitter for the login and leaderboard. </p>
      <p>At the time of development, I was learning Vim and decided to use the same navigation controls for snake. The snake can only eat food in INSERT mode, and you cannot change direction until escaping INSERT mode</p>
      <p>On August 16, Vim Snake made the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6223946" target="_blank">front page of Hacker News</a> which resulted in significant exposure and positive feedback.</p>

      <p>Ever wondered what's taking up all that space in your Dropbox? Visualize and explore the contents of your Dropbox to easily find the files or folders taking up the most space.</p>
      <p>I was responsible for the entire project. Site built with Sinatra. Authentication using Dropbox API. Graphs with Google Charts</p>
      <p>The most interesting part of the project was getting the size of every folder, which involved recursively drilling into each folder and its contents to add up the total size.</p>
