      '<p>This is a feature I always wanted on Github, so I decided to build it as a browser extension/external app.</p><p>It allows you to view the git history in the context of a single file. So you can view the entire file contents and go back through commits to visualize how it has changed.</p><p>The coolest thing about this app is that authenticated requests are made directly to the github API from the client (Backbone.js), without the need to go through my server. All requests are also cached in local storage, making for a really fast and responsive experience</p>',

The snake can only eat food in INSERT mode, and you cannot change direction until escaping INSERT mode</p><p>On August 16, Vim Snake made the <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6223946' target='_blank'>front page of Hacker News</a> which resulted in significant exposure and positive feedback.</p>",
